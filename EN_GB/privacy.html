                <p>7.5. The Customer acknowledges that the Supplier has no control over any Customer Data hosted as part of the provision of the Platform and, although it reserves the right to do so, the Supplier does not actively monitor the content of the Customer Data.</p>

                <p>7.7. Zeguro respects the rules and laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates, as well as the privacy and rights of its customers. Accordingly, Zeguro provides Customer Information in response to law enforcement requests only when we reasonably believe that we are legally required to do so. To protect our customers’ rights, we carefully review requests to ensure that they comply with the law. Zeguro reserves the right to disclose Customer Data to law enforcement officials in the investigation of fraud or other alleged unlawful activities, only after law enforcement officials provide legal process appropriate for the type of information sought, such as a subpoena, court order, or a warrant.</p>
                <p>7.8. The Customer shall indemnify the Supplier from and against all loss caused to the Supplier as a result of the use by the Customer or a User of Infringing Data on the Platform.</p>

Any information that we receive through such monitoring and communication will be added to the information we already hold about you and may also be used for the purposes listed in clause 10 above.</p>
                <p>11. <strong>Overseas transfers (EEA Users only)</strong></p>
                <p>11.1. <strong>From time to time we may need to transfer your Data to countries outside the European Economic Area, which comprises the EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein (“EEA”)</strong>. Non-EEA countries that we may need to transfer your Data to include the United States of America, because we are primarily based there.</p>
                <p>11.2. Such countries may not have similar protections in place regarding protection and use of your data as those set out in this Policy. Therefore, if we do transfer your Data to countries outside the EEA we will take reasonable steps in accordance with applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements to ensure adequate protections are in place to ensure the security of your Data, including:</p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">11.2.1. use of approved contractual clauses; and</p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">11.2.2. <strong>ensuring that we only transfer your Data to persons or entities that are appropriately authorized and/or accredited to process Personal Data in compliance with applicable Privacy and Data Protection Requirements.</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-left:30px;">11.2.3. By submitting your Data to us in accordance with this Policy you consent to these transfers for the purposes specified in this Policy.</p>

                <p>13.5. You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we delete all Personal Data we hold about you (the ‘right of erasure’).

If this is the case, we will let you know.</p>
                <p>13.6. You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data, for example where the Personal Data is inaccurate or where you have objected to the processing (see clause 20.6 below).</p>

If you request the right to data portability and it is not available to you we will let you know.</p>
                <p>13.8. You have the right in certain circumstances to object to the processing of your Personal Data.

                <p>13.9. You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, for example where a computer algorithm (rather than a person) makes decisions which affect your contractual rights.

                <p>21. <strong>Notice to End Users</strong></p>
                <p>Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.</p>
                <p>Administrators are able to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <ul style="width:100%;">
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">require you to reset your account password;</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">access information in and about your account;</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">access or retain information stored as part of your account;</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">In some cases, administrators can also:</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">change the email address associated with your account;</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">change your information, including profile information;</li>
                    <li style="padding-left:30px;">restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date. &nbsp;You will be notified if this happens. </p>
                <p>If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, use your personal email address to register for or access the Services. &nbsp;If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile. &nbsp;Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.</p>
                <p>Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.</p>
