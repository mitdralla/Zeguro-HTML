              <p><strong>A. General Terms of Service</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Welcome to Zeguro, located at www.zeguro.com or www.zeguro.co.uk , the website and online service of Zeguro Inc., a company registered in San Francisco whose registered office is at 101A Clay St #280, San Francisco CA 94111 and with UK offices at 85 Great Portland Street, London, W1W 7LT (“Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”).  This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>By clicking “I Agree,” or the like indicating acceptance electronically, or by, installing, accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and you agree to be bound by this Terms of Service Agreement, and such other terms and policies referenced herein (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the our Privacy Policy, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.</strong></p>
              <p>Company reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as described below. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).</p>
              <p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.</p>

              <p style="width:100%;">1. <strong>Use of Our Service</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p>2. <strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
              <p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Company, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Company.</p>

              <p>3. <strong>Company Service</strong></p>
              <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service as permitted by the features of the Service.  Company reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the Company Content (as defined below).  Company may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>

              <p>4. <strong>Company Accounts</strong></p>
              <p>Your Company account gives you access to the Service and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users.  If you open an account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s and each of its Users' behalf. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each User also personally accepts this Agreement. By connecting to Company with a third-party service (eg, GSuite, Amazon Web Services etc), you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service in accordance with our Privacy Policy and as permitted by that service.</p>
              <p>You may never use another User’s account without permission.  When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.  You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.  We require you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.  You must notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.  Company will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
              <p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in the “Settings” area of your profile page. By providing Company your email address you will receive Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.  We may also use your email address to send you other messages as set out in our Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>We may, now or in the future, allow you to link your account for the Service to your account(s) on third party services, such as social networking sites, Anti-virus providers, cloud services & other such sites deemed necessary to use the service ("Third Party Accounts"). Linking, accessing, or using a Third Party Account in this way may be subject to the additional terms of the applicable Third Party Account. You are solely responsible for complying with all Third Party Account terms. If you link your account for the Service to a Third Party Account, you authorize us to store and use your login credentials to access your Third Party Account on your behalf as your agent to enable your use of the Service with content, information, and features available through Third Party Accounts.</p>

              <p>5. <strong>Service Rules</strong></p>
              <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser, except that Company grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from our Services for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p>
              <p>Accessing the audiovisual content available on the Service for any purpose or in any manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited.  “Streaming” means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Company Service to a User’s device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the User.</p>
              <p>You authorize us to perform Web Vulnerability Scans (as defined below) on any device, domain and web app specified in the Zeguro "Web Vulnerability" module.</p>
              <p>Zeguro Web Vulnerability Scans are conducted to ascertain the compliance of network devices and applications with certain published security standards and to disclose security vulnerabilities that may be present. Security audits may be performed with the assistance of Zeguro employees or its appointed contractors, and may from time to time include additional probing and validation beyond the scope of Zeguro’s automated scanning system. In certain cases, the exploitation of a vulnerability and/or minimal extraction of data from the target server may be conducted to support Zeguro’s security audit findings, or to illustrate a vulnerability to you. Security audits typically include, but are not limited to, port scanning and port connections, evaluating services by checking versions and responses to certain requests, and crawling websites to perform testing of forms, form submissions, application responses, or to confirm the existence of certain files or services used.</p>
              <p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service.  We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason.  Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.</p>
              <p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Company Users.  We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.  Company shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.</p>

              <p>6. <strong>User Content</strong></p>
              <p>Some areas of the Service allow Users to post content such as profile information, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service “User Content”).  We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours; however, by sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with your settings and this Agreement. Company has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.</p>
              <p>Zeguro has no obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the Service. Nonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on your violation of this Agreement or in response to takedown requests that we receive following our guidelines for Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Service or (2) suspend your access to the Services. We will generally alert you when we take such action and give you a reasonable opportunity to cure your breach, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Service or other users, we may suspend your access immediately without notice. You will continue to be charged for the Service during any suspension period. We have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to the Service as described in this section.</p>
              <p>You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, defamatory, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy.  To the extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby represent that you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including without limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights, with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics) and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the power to grant the license granted below.  Company reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Company believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.  You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.</p>
              <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.</p>

              <p>In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:</p>

              <p>7. You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.</p>
              <p>8. Your User Content and Company’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.</p>
              <p>9. Company may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.</p>
              <p>10. To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.</p>
              <p>Company takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service.  You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content.  You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Company shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.</p>

              <p>11. <strong>User Content License Grant</strong></p>
              <p>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Company a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Company’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.</p>

              <p>12. <strong>Our Proprietary Rights</strong></p>
              <p>Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content belonging to other Users (the “Company Content”), and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of Company and its licensors (including other Users who post User Content to the Service).  Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any Company Content.  Use of the Company Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.</p>

              <p>Certain elements of the Service and Company Content may comprise open source software and may be used by you according to the terms and conditions of the specific license under which the relevant open source software is distributed and you agree to comply with the terms of any such open source software licenses.

              <p>You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Service, including without limitation about how to improve the Service or our products (“Ideas”).  By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Company under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.  You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Company does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Company, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.</p>

              <p>13. <strong>Company Property</strong></p>
              <p>Certain aspects of the Service may allow you to obtain certain reputational or status indicators and/or fictional property representing virtual achievements (for instance, trophies or powers) (“Company Property”). You understand and agree that regardless of terminology used, Company Property represents a limited license right governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and available for distribution at Company’s sole discretion.  Company Property is not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from Company at any time.  You acknowledge that you do not own the account you use to access the Service, nor do you possess any rights of access or rights to data stored by or on behalf of Company on Company servers, including without limitation any data representing or embodying any or all of your Company Property.  You agree that Company has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Company Property as it sees fit in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Company will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right.  All data on Company’s servers are subject to deletion, alteration or transfer.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH DATA BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DATA, ACCOUNT HISTORY AND ACCOUNT CONTENT RESIDING ON COMPANY’S SERVERS, MAY BE DELETED, ALTERED, MOVED OR TRANSFERRED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON IN COMPANY’S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND.

              <p>14. <strong>Paid Services</strong></p>
              <p>15. <strong>Billing Policies.</strong> Certain aspects of the Service may be provided for a fee or other charge.  If you elect to use paid aspects of the Service, you agree to our Pricing and Payment Terms, as we may update them from time to time.  Company may add new services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion.  Any change to our pricing or payment terms shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in this Agreement.</p>
              <p>16. <strong>No Refunds.</strong>  You may cancel your Company account at any time; however, there are no refunds for cancellation.  In the event that Company suspends or terminates your account or this Agreement for your breach of this Agreement, you understand and agree that you shall receive no refund or exchange for any Company Property, any unused time on a subscription, any license or subscription fees for any portion of the Service, any content or data associated with your account, or for anything else.</p>
              <p>17. <strong>Payment Information; Taxes.</strong>  All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current.  You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred.  You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.</p>
              <p>18. <strong>Payments.</strong>  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, Company shall remit payments due to you hereunder no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month in which the applicable fees are received.  Payment shall be in the form you select when you register for the Service, or as subsequently updated as permitted by the Service.  Payments shall only be made in those months in which the amount due to you totals at least £100.  Unpaid amounts due shall accrue until the next month in which the amount due is at least $100.  Company reserves the right to withhold payment or charge back to your account any amounts otherwise due to us under this Agreement, or amounts due to any breach of this Agreement by you, pending Company’s reasonable investigation of such breach.  To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with your account, which includes without limitation applicable tax information.  If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information.  Any third-party fees related to returned or cancelled payments due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment.  You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Service.  If you dispute any payment made hereunder, you must notify Company in writing within thirty (30) days of such payment.  Failure to so notify Company shall result in the waiver by you of any claim relating to such disputed payment.  Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Company.  No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Company or have any effect under this Agreement.  We may withhold any taxes or other amounts from payments due to you as required by law.</p>
              <p>19. <strong>No Professional Advice</strong></p>
              <p>If the Service provides professional information (for example, medical, legal, or financial), such information is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional advice.  No action should be taken based upon any information contained in the Service.  You should seek independent professional advice from a person who is licensed and/or qualified in the applicable area.</p>

              <p>20. <strong>Privacy</strong></p>
              <p>We care about the privacy of our Users.  You understand that by using the Service you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information and aggregate data as set forth in our Privacy Policy, and to have your personally identifiable information collected, used, transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>

              <p>21. <strong>Security</strong></p>
              <p>Company cares about the integrity and security of your personal information and uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and implement your privacy settings.

Company does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services.  If you access a third party website from the Service, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement and Company’s Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of such sites.  You expressly relieve Company from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, service, or content.  Additionally, your dealings with or participation in promotions of advertisers found on the Service, including payment and delivery of goods, and any other terms (such as warranties) are solely between you and such advertisers.

              <p>We may offer certain Products to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined below (“No-Charge Products”). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted for the period designated by us. You may not use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis or similar purposes. We may terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta products we make available (“Beta Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Products. We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 11 (No-Charge Products). All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of Beta Versions constitutes Zeguro’s Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support and Maintenance, warranty, and indemnity obligations.</p>

              <p>27. <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
              <p>Nothing in these terms shall limit or exclude the liability of a party for death or personal injury resulting from negligence, or fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

              <p>28. <strong>Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
              <p>29. <strong>Governing Law.</strong>  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of California, USA, without giving effect to the principles of that State relating to conflicts of laws. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding that is not otherwise subject to the arbitration provisions of Section 16(B) (Disputes) must be brought solely and exclusively in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable procedural rules of, the State or Federal court in San Francisco, California, USA, and each party irrevocably submits to the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts in San Francisco, California, USA, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any action, suit or proceeding brought by it or against it by the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Atlassian may bring a claim for equitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.</p>
              <p>30. <strong>Disputes.</strong>  For any dispute with Company, you agree to first contact us at legal@zeguro.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall proceed to binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The parties shall seek to mutually appoint an arbitrator in one of the following cities as mutually agreed between by the parties: London (United Kingdom) or San Francisco, CA (USA). If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then the arbitration shall proceed in San Francisco, CA.

The language of the arbitration shall be English.</p>
              <p>31. <strong>General</strong>
              <p>32. <strong>Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Company without restriction.  Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
              <p>33. <strong>Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.</strong>  Company may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Company in our sole discretion.  Company reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement.  Company is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.  Company may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically.  When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page.  Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.  If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>
              <p>34. <strong>Documents.</strong> By using the Services, you agree to have all records and documents provided to you in electronic form.

However, you have the right to receive communications from us, including any insurance policy, in paper form if you wish by withdrawing this consent.

              <p>35. <strong>Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong>  This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Company in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Company concerning the Service.  If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>
              <p>36. <strong>No Waiver.</strong>  No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Company’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
              <p>You can contact Company by mail at <a href="mailto:info@zeguro.com">info@zeguro.com</a> or by calling US: <a href="tel:18559800660">+1 (855)980-0660</a> or UK <a href="tel:4402034733800">+44 (0) 203 473 3800</a> if you have a question or concern about any product or service we sell over the Internet.</p>
